    "\n",
    "The strategy explores all the edges connected to the most recently discovered vertex $v$. Once all the edges are explored, the search backtracks to explore the remaining edges coming out of the vertex from which $v$ was discovered. This process repeats until all the vertices reachable from the source are reached. \n",
